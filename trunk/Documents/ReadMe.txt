FFC (Free Foundation Classes)

This is an open source library designed for compiling
MFC/ATL applications by gcc.

There are lots of existed projects based on MFC/ATL all
over the world. However, it is not easy, or maybe
impossible, to migrate them to other OS, such as Linux.
I tried to build MFC source by gcc but failed for that
many Microsoft specified compiler features are needed
in the build process. Moreover, the license of MFC/ATL is
another problem. Finally, I decided to write this MFC/ATL
compatible open source library from scratch.

Since MFC was created by microsoft before many C++
standards, Some design in MFC is not so preferable.
In this project, I have been trying to use some new C++
technology to reimplement MFC, as well as ATL, in order
to make it more efficient or elegant.

I found there is another open source project called OFC
(Open Foundation Classes). But it seems that there is not
any update since 2004. And I try to start this new project
but not based on OFC, because some of my designs are
different from OFC.

Any sugguestion is welcome to: yanlinlin82[at]gmail.com
